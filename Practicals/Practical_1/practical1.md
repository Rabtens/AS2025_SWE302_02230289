## Introduction

This report documents my work on the testing component of the SWE5006 capstone project at the National University of Singapore (NUS). My tutor provided a complete Kahoot quiz clone application, and I was responsible for designing and implementing a comprehensive testing strategy to validate all functionality and ensure quality assurance.

## Project Overview

I was given a fully functional Kahoot clone built with modern web technologies and tasked with creating a complete testing suite. My role was to:

- Analyze the application to understand all its features
- Design comprehensive test cases covering all functionality
- Implement automated tests using Playwright
- Validate the application's behavior across different scenarios
- Document findings and ensure quality standards

This project allowed me to demonstrate my understanding of software testing principles, test automation, and quality assurance practices.

## The Application I Tested

### Application Features

The Kahoot clone I tested included these main components:

1. **Quiz Interface** - Interactive quiz-taking experience
2. **Timer System** - 30-second countdown for each question
3. **Scoring System** - Real-time score tracking
4. **Feedback System** - Visual feedback for correct/incorrect answers
5. **Game State Management** - Start, playing, and end states
6. **Responsive Design** - Multi-device compatibility

### Technology Stack Used

The application was built with:

- **React** with **TypeScript** for the frontend
- **Vite** for build tooling
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Lucide Icons** for UI elements
- **Docker** support for deployment

### User Flow I Had to Test

1. User clicks "Start Quiz" button
2. Quiz begins with first question and timer
3. User selects answers and receives feedback
4. Application auto-advances through questions
5. Final score displays with restart option

## My Testing Approach

### Testing Strategy I Developed

I designed a comprehensive testing strategy that covered:

1. **Functional Testing** - Verifying all features work as expected
2. **User Experience Testing** - Ensuring smooth user interactions
3. **Edge Case Testing** - Handling unusual scenarios
4. **Responsive Design Testing** - Multi-device compatibility
5. **Performance Testing** - Timer accuracy and responsiveness
6. **Data Validation Testing** - Score calculations and question integrity

### Testing Methodology I Used

I followed these testing principles:

- **Black Box Testing** - Testing from user perspective without knowing internal code
- **End-to-End Testing** - Simulating complete user journeys
- **Automated Testing** - Creating repeatable, reliable test scripts
- **Cross-Browser Testing** - Ensuring compatibility across different browsers
- **Regression Testing** - Making sure new changes don't break existing functionality

## Testing Framework I Used

### Playwright for End-to-End Testing

I chose Playwright as my primary testing framework because:

- **Cross-Browser Support** - Tests run on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- **Real User Simulation** - Clicks, typing, and navigation like actual users
- **Async/Await Support** - Handles timing and loading properly
- **Built-in Waiting** - Automatically waits for elements to load
- **Screenshot Capabilities** - Visual validation and debugging

### Testing Tools I Set Up

```bash
npm run test          # Run all my tests
npm run test:ui       # Run tests with visual interface
npm run test:debug    # Debug tests step by step
npm run test:report   # Generate detailed test reports
```

## Test Cases I Created

2. **Installed Dependencies**: Ran `npm install` to set up all required packages
3. **Started Application**: Used `npm run dev` to run the app locally
4. **Verified Functionality**: Manually tested to understand all features before writing automated tests

### Testing Environment Configuration

1. **Playwright Installation**: Set up Playwright testing framework
2. **Browser Configuration**: Configured tests to run on multiple browsers
3. **Test Structure**: Organized test files logically by functionality
4. **Reporting Setup**: Configured detailed test reporting and screenshots

### My Testing Workflow

1. **Manual Exploration**: First played through the quiz manually to understand behavior
2. **Test Planning**: Created detailed test cases before writing code
3. **Test Implementation**: Wrote Playwright scripts for each test case
4. **Test Execution**: Ran tests repeatedly to ensure reliability
5. **Results Analysis**: Reviewed test reports and investigated any failures

## My Testing Process

### Phase 1: Application Analysis

Before writing any tests, I spent time understanding the application:

- Played through the quiz multiple times
- Identified all user interactions possible
- Noted the expected behavior for each feature
- Documented the complete user journey

### Phase 2: Test Case Design

I created detailed test cases covering:

- Happy path scenarios (everything works perfectly)
- Error scenarios (things that could go wrong)
- Edge cases (unusual but possible situations)
- Performance scenarios (timing-dependent features)

### Phase 3: Test Implementation

I wrote Playwright test scripts that:

- Simulate real user interactions
- Wait appropriately for page loads and animations
- Capture screenshots for visual verification
- Handle both success and failure scenarios

### Phase 4: Test Execution and Validation

I ran my test suite:

- Multiple times to ensure consistency
- On different browsers to check compatibility
- With different timing scenarios
- While monitoring for any flaky or unreliable tests

## Test Results and Findings
